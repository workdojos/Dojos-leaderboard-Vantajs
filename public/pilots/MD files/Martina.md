Project Brief: Support Group Industry Project

Team Leader: Martina

Assignment: The support group industry has seen a significant increase in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to remote work. The industry needs to adapt to the changes in order to continue providing effective support to individuals. The team of moderators will work remotely from their PC's at home to solve the challenges facing the support group industry within 90 days.

**Goals**:

Enhance the virtual support group experience for individuals, ensuring that it is equivalent to in-person support groups.
Improve the efficiency of virtual support groups to ensure that moderators can handle larger groups with ease.
Develop new technology solutions to enhance the virtual support group experience, such as virtual reality and augmented reality.
Increase the accessibility of support groups to individuals, regardless of their location or device.
Stakes:

The success of this project will directly impact the well-being of individuals who rely on support groups to improve their mental and emotional health.
The support group industry must adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic in order to remain relevant and effective.
Failure to complete this project successfully may lead to a decline in the support group industry, resulting in the loss of jobs and reduction of support for individuals in need.
Reserves:

The team will have access to the latest technology and tools to enhance their virtual support group experience.
The team will receive training and support from industry experts to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to complete the project successfully.
The team will be provided with a virtual workspace where they can collaborate and communicate with one another, as well as access to a project management tool to track progress.
Successful completion of this project will grant all contributing members XP and unlock a new challenge in the quest to revolutionize the workplace for moderators worldwide.
