Seth is a 35-year-old park ranger from Washington. He grew up in a small town just outside of Seattle and has always had a love for the outdoors. He spent most of his childhood exploring the woods and mountains surrounding his hometown, and it was this love of nature that led him to pursue a career as a park ranger.

Seth is a very dedicated and hardworking individual. He takes his job as a park ranger very seriously and is always looking for ways to improve and protect the parks he oversees. He is also very friendly and approachable, often taking the time to talk to visitors and help them plan their trips.

Despite his outgoing personality, Seth has a few secrets. He struggles with a fear of heights, which he keeps hidden from his colleagues and visitors. He also has a bit of a wild streak, often taking risks and pushing himself to the limit in order to experience new adventures.

Seth's strengths lie in his technical skills. He is an expert in wilderness survival and has a deep knowledge of the local flora and fauna. He is also a skilled navigator and has a keen eye for spotting potential hazards.

Seth's weaknesses include his fear of heights and a tendency to take unnecessary risks. He also struggles with time management and can sometimes get caught up in the excitement of exploring new areas, neglecting his other responsibilities.

Seth's goal is to one day become a park supervisor, overseeing multiple parks and working to protect and preserve the natural environment. He also hopes to eventually climb Mount Rainier, despite his fear of heights.

In his free time, Seth enjoys hiking, camping, and rock climbing. He is also an avid photographer and loves to capture the beauty of the parks he oversees.
