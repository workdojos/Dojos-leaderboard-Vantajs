**Name**: Blythe "Wildcard" Thompson
**Age**: 32
**Location**: Currently traveling the world, but originally from the United States

**History**: Blythe Thompson was always a thrill-seeker and adventurer at heart. Growing up, he spent all of his free time exploring the woods near his home and reading books about famous explorers. He always dreamed of one day traveling the world and experiencing all the excitement and danger it had to offer.

After graduating high school, Blythe saved up enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Africa, where he began his journey as a professional adventurer. He quickly made a name for himself in the adventure community, taking on dangerous expeditions to remote and unexplored parts of the world. He has since traveled to every continent, including climbing Mount Everest and diving to the depths of the Mariana Trench.

**Personality Traits**: Blythe is fearless, confident, and always up for a challenge. He is also very charismatic and easy to get along with, often making friends with locals in the places he visits. However, he can be reckless and impulsive at times, sometimes putting himself in danger without fully thinking things through.

**Secrets**: Blythe has a fear of heights, something he has kept hidden from his friends and colleagues. He also has a tattoo on his back that he got during a wild night in Thailand, that he is not particularly proud of.

**Strengths**: Blythe is incredibly physically fit and skilled in survival techniques. He is also a skilled marksman and proficient in several languages.

**Weaknesses**: Blythe's impulsiveness can sometimes put him in danger, and his fear of heights can limit his ability to complete certain challenges.

**Technical Skills**: Blythe is an expert in navigation, rock climbing, and white-water rafting. He is also skilled in first aid and has a basic understanding of mechanics, which he uses to repair his equipment in the field.

**Goals**: Blythe's ultimate goal is to complete the "Explorer's Grand Slam," which includes climbing the highest peak on every continent and reaching the North and South Poles. He also hopes to one day open his own adventure company and share his love of exploration with others.

**Hobbies**: Blythe enjoys reading and writing about his adventures, and also likes to play guitar and sing in his spare time. He also enjoys practicing martial arts, both for fitness and as a form of self-defense.
