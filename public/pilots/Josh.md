Josh is a 35-year-old sales coach from Sydney, Australia. He grew up in a small town in the outback and always had a passion for business and sales. He went to college and studied marketing, and after graduation, he landed a job as a sales representative for a big pharmaceutical company. He quickly climbed the ranks and became a top performer, earning a reputation as a skilled negotiator and a natural leader.

Josh is a charismatic and outgoing person, always eager to make new connections and build relationships. He is a natural leader and is respected by his colleagues for his ability to motivate and inspire others. He is also a great listener and is always willing to help others achieve their goals.

Josh has a secret, though. He struggles with imposter syndrome, despite his many successes. He often worries that he's not good enough and that his colleagues will find out he's a fraud. This insecurity can sometimes hold him back from taking risks and reaching his full potential.

Josh's strengths include his ability to connect with others, his natural leadership skills, and his ability to think outside the box. He is also highly organized and is able to prioritize tasks effectively.

His weaknesses include his tendency to be too perfectionistic and his tendency to procrastinate. He also struggles with self-doubt and can be overly critical of himself.

Josh is highly skilled in sales techniques and strategies, as well as marketing and advertising. He is also proficient in using CRM software and data analysis tools.

Josh's goal is to become the head of sales for his company and to eventually start his own consulting business. He wants to help other salespeople achieve their goals and reach their full potential.

In his free time, Josh enjoys travelling, hiking, and playing guitar. He also volunteers at a local charity that helps at-risk youth.
